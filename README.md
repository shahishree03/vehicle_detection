# Vehicle Detection System


## Overview

This project implements a real-time **Vehicle Detection System** using Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv3. The system is designed to monitor traffic flow, detect vehicles, and manage parking zones efficiently. It provides a solution for urban traffic congestion and parking challenges through accurate vehicle detection and data processing.

## Features

- **Real-Time Vehicle Detection:** Detects vehicles in traffic and parking zones with 95.4% accuracy.
- **Traffic Monitoring:** Tracks vehicle flow and congestion in real-time.
- **Parking Management:** Provides updates on available parking spaces and maintains historical parking data.
- **Data Storage:** Stores vehicle count and parking data in a SQL database for analysis and reporting.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** Backend development and data handling.
- **OpenCV:** Real-time image and video processing.
- **YOLOv3:** Object detection model for vehicle recognition.
- **NumPy & Matplotlib:** Data manipulation and visualization.
- **SQL:** Database used for storing vehicle detection data.
